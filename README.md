# Adaptive Learning Platform

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **personalized learning website** that helps users identify their **learning style** and provides tailored study material accordingly.  
- Users enter a **subject of interest** and take a **short survey**.  
- Based on the responses, the system determines the user’s **type of learner** (e.g., visual, auditory, kinesthetic, etc.).  
- The platform then provides:  
  - **Detailed explanations** of the subject topics.  
  - **Interactive quizzes** for each topic to reinforce understanding.

The goal is to make learning **adaptive, engaging, and effective**.
